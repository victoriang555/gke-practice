# Overview
Based on documentation to run jobs in GKE. Should not be confused with Kubernetes jobs. Jobs are represented by Kubernetes Job objects
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/jobs

## How to create a job
```
kubectl apply -f <config file path>
```

## Job Config Files
This directory contains various job config files, and those are described below.


### [Multiple pods config](config-2.yaml)
If you have a parallel Job, you can set a completion count using the optional completions field. This field specifies how many Pods should terminate successfully before the Job is complete. The completions field accepts a non-zero, positive value.

Omitting completions or specifying a zero value causes the success of any Pod to signal the success of all Pods.

### [Concurrent pod running, true parallelism config](config-3.yaml)
By default, Job Pods do not run in parallel. The optional parallelism field specifies the maximum desired number of Pods a Job should run concurrently at any given time.

The actual number of Pods running in a steady state might be less than the parallelism value if the remaining work is less than the parallelism value. If you have also set completions, the actual number of Pods running in parallel does not exceed the number of remaining completions. A Job may throttle Pod creation in response to excessive Pod creation failure.

### [Retries config](config.yaml)
By default, a Job runs uninterrupted unless there is a failure, at which point the Job defers to the backoffLimit. The backoffLimit field specifies the number of retries before marking the job as failed; the default value is 6. The number of retries applies per Pod, not globally. This means that if multiple Pods fail (when parallelism is greater than 1), the job continues to run until a single Pod fails backoffLimit of times. Once the backoffLimit has been reached, the Job is marked as failed and any running Pods will be terminated.

For example, in our example job, we set the number of retries to 4

### Pod Replacement - no config, just notes
Pod replacement
Job recreates Pods honoring the backoffLimit when the current Pod is considered failed in scenarios such as:

The Pod container exits with a non-zero error code.
When a Node is rebooted, the kubelet may mark the Pod as Failed after the reboot
Under certain scenarios a Job that has not completed replaces the Pod without considering the backoffLimit, such as:

Manually killing a Pod would not set the Pod phase to Failed. The replacement Pod may be created even before the current pod's termination grace period is completed.
When a Node is drained (manually or during auto-upgrade), the Pod is terminated honoring a drain grace period and is replaced.
When a Node is deleted, the Pod is garbage collected (marked as deleted) and is replaced.

### [Specifying a deadline](config-4.yaml)
By default, a Job creates new Pods forever if its Pods fail continuously. If you prefer not to have a Job retry forever, you can specify a deadline value using the optional activeDeadlineSeconds field.

A deadline grants a Job a specific amount of time, in seconds, to complete its tasks successfully before terminating.

To specify a deadline, add the activeDeadlineSeconds value to the Job's spec field in the manifest file. For example, the linked configuration specifies that the Job has 100 seconds to complete successfully.

Note: Ensure that you add the activeDeadlineSecond value to the Job's spec field. The spec field in the Pod template field also accepts an activeDeadlineSeconds value.

If a Job does not complete successfully before the deadline, the Job ends with the status DeadlineExceeded. This causes creation of Pods to stop and causes existing Pods to be deleted.

### Specifying a Pod selector
Manually specifying a selector is useful if you want to update a Job's Pod template, but you want the Job's current Pods to run under the updated Job.

A Job is instantiated with a selector field. The selector generates a unique identifier for the Job's Pods. The generated ID does not overlap with any other Jobs. Generally, you would not set this field yourself: setting a selector value which overlaps with another Job can cause issues with Pods in the other Job. To set the field yourself, you must specify manualSelector: True in the Job's spec field.

For example, you can run kubectl get job my-job --output=yaml to see the Job's specification, which contains the selector generated for its Pods: [config-with-selectors](config-5.yaml)

When you create a new Job, you can set the manualSelector value to True, then set the selector field's job-uid value like the following: [config-with-manual-selector](config-6.yaml)

Pods created by my-new-job use the previous Pod UID.
Note: Jobs have their own UIDs. The new Job's UID is different from the previous Job's UID.

### Notes on jobs
Learn more about job specs [here](/kubernetes-jobs/job-specs)

In GKE, a Job is a controller object that represents a finite task. Jobs differ from other controller objects in that Jobs manage the task as it runs to completion, rather than managing an ongoing desired state (such as the total number of running Pods).

Jobs are useful for large computation and batch-oriented tasks. Jobs can be used to support parallel execution of Pods. You can use a Job to run independent but related work items in parallel: sending emails, rendering frames, transcoding files, scanning database keys, etc. However, Jobs are not designed for closely-communicating parallel processes such as continuous streams of background processes.

In GKE, there are two types of Jobs:

1. Non-parallel Job: A Job which creates only one Pod (which is re-created if the Pod terminates unsuccessfully), and which is completed when the Pod terminates successfully.
2. Parallel jobs with a completion count: A Job that is completed when a certain number of Pods terminate successfully. You specify the desired number of completions using the completions field. Omitting completions or specifying a zero value causes the success of any Pod to signal the success of all Pods.

Jobs are represented by Kubernetes Job objects. When a Job is created, the Job controller creates one or more Pods and ensures that its Pods terminate successfully. As its Pods terminate, a Job tracks how many Pods completed their tasks successfully. Once the desired number of successful completions is reached, the Job is complete.

Similar to other controllers, a Job controller creates a new Pod if one of its Pods fails or is deleted.

### Notes about this practice workflow
1. This Job computes pi to 2000 places then prints it.

## Setup
In addition to the setup in the root README, you should also do the following for this kubernetes jobs

1. Install minikube https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/


### Minikube
Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day

```
# Start minikube
minikube start
```

## Simplest Example Without Additional Setup
```
# This assumes you already have kubectl installed
kubectl apply -f https://kubernetes.io/examples/controllers/job.yaml
# Expected output
job.batch/pi created
```
```
# Check the job status
kubectl describe jobs/pi
# Expected output
